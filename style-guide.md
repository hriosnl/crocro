# Crocro: A Cross-Browser Chat Extension's Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

**Sleek • Minimal • Clean**

This style guide emphasizes simplicity, readability, and modern aesthetics. The interface should feel lightweight, distraction-free, and focus entirely on the conversation.

Usage Guidelines
Do's

✅ Keep generous whitespace between elements
✅ Use consistent spacing from the spacing scale
✅ Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text
✅ Use subtle shadows only when necessary
✅ Keep animations under 300ms duration
✅ Test on both light and dark system themes

Don'ts

❌ Use bright, saturated colors
❌ Add unnecessary visual elements
❌ Use more than 2-3 font weights
❌ Create busy or cluttered layouts
❌ Use heavy drop shadows or gradients
❌ Animate too many elements at once

### Responsive Considerations

Since this is a browser extension popup with fixed dimensions, focus on:

- Readable text sizes (minimum 14px)
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Adequate spacing for easy interaction
- Smooth scrolling in the messages area

## Dark Mode

- Optional but expected in 2025—dark backgrounds (#121212) with accessible contrast.

## Microinteractions

- Smooth hover animations (scale 1.02, fade, subtle shadows).
- Loading states with skeleton screens or shimmer.
